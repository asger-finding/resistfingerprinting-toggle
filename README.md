# resistfingerprinting-toggle

## What is privacy.resistFingerprinting?

See [Mozilla's corresponding support article](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting) and check out the [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) project while you're at it!

## How does the add-on work?

By pressing the add-on icon you can toggle a tab host (eg., [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org)) between having privacy.resistFingerprinting enabled or not.  
Resist Fingerprinting only works globally, so this add-on just switches the state when you focus a new tab or navigate to a different URL. This is not a perfect privacy solution so please use [CanvasBlocker](https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker) too!
