# Contributing to Resist Fingerprinting

## i18n Localization & Translations

These are the steps if you want to contribute messages for a new language:

- Figure out short name for your language. (e.g., `es`)
- Duplicate the `en` directory and rename the new one with the short name. (e.g., `es`)
- Modify the `message` fields in `messages.json`, but leave the descriptions intact. You can read more about i18n [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/i18n/).
- File a pull request with the new folder and modified messages.json file.
- Done!
